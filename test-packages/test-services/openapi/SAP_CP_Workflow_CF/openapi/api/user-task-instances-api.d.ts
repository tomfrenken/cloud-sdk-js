/**
 * Workflow API for Cloud Foundry
 * This API uses the SAP Cloud Platform Workflow service. With the API, you can, for example, start new workflow instances and work with tasks.  Note (relevant only for SAP API Business Hub): For authentication purposes, the API uses OAuth 2.0 security (with JSON Web Token, JWT). Thus, \"Try Out\" only works with an explicitly configured environment. For more information on how to obtain the necessary parameters, please see [Determine Service Configuration Parameters](https://help.sap.com/viewer/e157c391253b4ecd93647bf232d18a83/Cloud/en-US/abb1f66b2c3b4983b6b656654cfc3d2b.html) in the documentation. The OAuth client you use must have [extended scopes](https://help.sap.com/viewer/e157c391253b4ecd93647bf232d18a83/Cloud/en-US/baf2847f6d1c401a83ca3a1427b8ff84.html).  Note: These APIs are designed for loosely coupled clients. This means:  - If workflow service adds fields to responses, the API version number does not increase. Your client must ignore new fields. - The order of fields in responses and of entries in arrays may change. This applies unless the API provides an explicit means to specify the desired order.

You can specify parameters for other attributes in an analogous way. If you specify a parameter several times, the logical operators apply as outlined in the overall description of this API. If custom task attributes with different IDs are present in the URL, only tasks which contain all of them with the values specified will be returned as a response to the request. If a query by custom task attributes matches too many task definitions, you have to limit the query further. Refer, for example, to parameter \&#39;definitionId\&#39;.
     * @param {string} [definitionId] The definition ID of the user task. It consists of the ID of the task defined in the workflow definition (task definition ID) as well as the workflow definition ID delimited by an \&#39;@\&#39; sign. For optimal performance, specify this parameter when searching for tasks by custom task attributes. If the custom task attribute IDs from the query match more than 50 task definitions, you have to specify one or more task definition IDs when searching for tasks by custom task attributes.

     * @param {string} [containsText] Text, which should be contained in at least one of the following fields of the user task instance:   * subject  * description  * activityId  * id  * processor  * workflowDefinitionId  * workflowInstanceId  Performed filtering is case-insensitive. You must not use this parameter more than once.
     * @param {string} [attributesExampleCustomAttribute] Example of a parameter that filters task instances by the value of the custom task attribute with the ID \&#39;ExampleCustomAttribute\&#39;. You can specify parameters for other attributes in an analogous way. If you specify a parameter several times, the logical operators apply as outlined in the overall description of this API. If custom task attributes with different IDs are present in the URL, only tasks which contain all of them with the values specified will be returned as a response to the request. If a query by custom task attributes matches too many task definitions, you have to limit the query further. Refer, for example, to parameter \&#39;definitionId\&#39;.
     * @param {string} [definitionId] The definition ID of the user task. It consists of the ID of the task defined in the workflow definition (task definition ID) as well as the workflow definition ID delimited by an \&#39;@\&#39; sign. For optimal performance, specify this parameter when searching for tasks by custom task attributes. If the custom task attribute IDs from the query match more than 50 task definitions, you have to specify one or more task definition IDs when searching for tasks by custom task attributes.
     * @param {*} [options] Override http request option.
